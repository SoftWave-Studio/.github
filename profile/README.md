## Hi there 👋

### About Us

We are a group of Software Engineering students from Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas (UPC). Our mission is to collaboratively develop innovative ideas and work together to achieve our goals. This organization serves as a platform for us to share projects, collaborate on code, and grow as future engineers. Join us on our journey as we learn, create, and build solutions to real-world problems.
